Hanging like a sleeping swing
Under dead channel skies
It's a place where no one sleeps
& There's a boy who lives next door
He dances with a headless girl
It's the weirdest fashion show
Distant voices from the sink
I often feel I'm losing it
Shadow kissing in the park
I sometimes wish you stayed with me

It's a cold odd neighbourhood...

When I see you walking home
Humming make-out city blues
Do you sometimes think of me?
& Time's a friend to all who try
And disappear inside a song
That no one dares to sing
Did it hurt you when we fought?
Did it please you when we fucked?
Make the devil pay your debts
A charming man with metallic hair

It's a cold odd neighbourhood...

Cold
Odd
Neighbourhood...
