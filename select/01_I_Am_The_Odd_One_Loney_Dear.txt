I am sorry honestly I'm sorry I ruined your day
I am sorry I never meant to inflict no other than myself
I am sorry really I am sorry I ruined your plans
That I can manage the minutes for we meet to wipe the joy away

I came along, I turned the right to wrong turned it all to this
Nothing was said I poured the good out
I'm the peculiar one
I came along I brought the shade
I turned it all to this
You got it wrong
You had a glance at me
Said I'm the odd one

I"m sorry honestly I'm sorry I ruined it today
You have heard me I am sick for hundreds I'll never do again
Would you know me now when I lose it I cannot seize the still
And it eats my heart out as it makes the tranquility go away
Ah ah ha
I came along I brought the shade
I turned it all from here
You got it wrong you had a glance at me
Said I'm the odd one
I came along I turned the light to
I turned it all to this
Nothing was said
I poured the good out
I'm the peculiar one
