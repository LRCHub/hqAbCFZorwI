I was late for the wrong reasons
All borders and no light
Because God is a nothing phantom and a pocket light
Because it's late for the one reason, the sun was up all night
And I put my arms around you, but to hold you tight

On and on and on and on
Someone has to have sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?
On and on and on and on
Someone has to have sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?

People unite for the wrong reasons
These borders hold no light
Because God is a nothing phantom and a pocket light
Cause I stayed for the one reason, the sun was up all night
And I put your arms around you, but to hold you tight
On and on and on and on

Someone has sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?
On and on and on and on
Someone has sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?
On and on and on and on
Someone has sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?
On and on and on and on
Someone has too much sleep for me
Or is it all just letters and poems?
